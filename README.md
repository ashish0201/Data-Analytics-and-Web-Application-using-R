# Data-Analytics-and-Web-Application-using-R
My role was to help the development team in analyzing data and developing a web application (using a package in R called Shiny). The objective of the app was to apply data analytics on the GoForFit database that contains students' performance details. Several graphs were generated to display analyzed data graphically. The graphs were further used to identify trends on how students were performing in different areas of study.
